# YHack-2017

Python server built using Flask for REST Web API.
Prediction algorithm built using a Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn.
Android Client app built using Java.
Web Client built using jQuery.

Accuracy using test data is relatively low (around 30%) however it is higher than purely random, so it's something!

Prediction does not work, which explains why this project remains unfinished.
